enter the word to guess
create guessed_word string
set guessed_word equal to many underscores as the length of word
create empty guesses_array
set the loop number to 0
WHILE the loop number is still less than the length
    let the user put in an string character
    IF the user already guessed the string
        tell them that but don't count a loop
    ELSE IF there is a match
        tell them that's definitely there!
        change guessed_word to reflect the guess
        increase the loop number
    ELSE
        tell them if there is not a match, 

if guessed_word != input
    taunt
else 
    congratulate
